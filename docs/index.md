did you know that there's a significant number of things in the game ***Hades*** that never actually see use in the game? i can't yet speak for every possible category, but i know for a fact that a decent portion of the game's [Traits](whats-a-trait.md) are entirely unused in the final game. some of them are really interesting, though, so i'd like to dig a little deeper!

if this sounds interesting to you and you'd like to help out - with archival work, proofreading, art, or testing, drop into the [Hades Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/KuMbyrN) and ping me `@qaznotquaz#3300` in the `#datamining` channel!
