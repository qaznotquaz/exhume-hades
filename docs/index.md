did you know that there's a significant number of things in the game ***Hades*** that never actually see use in the game? i can't yet speak for every possible category, but i know for a fact that a decent portion of the game's [Traits](whats-a-trait) are entirely unused in the final game. some of them are really interesting, though, so i'd like to dig a little deeper!
