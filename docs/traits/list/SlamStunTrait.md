# SlamStunTrait 
![](Poseidon_08_Large.png)

---
## My Two Cents
> like the actually-used Breaking Waves boon (aka `SlamExplosionTrait`), this has the field `AddOnSlamWeapons = {"PoseidonCollisionBlast"}`. it differs by adding **3**/**4.5**/**6**/**7.5** second stun instead of an explosion, which feels kind of busted.

## Notes
* **Source:** Poseidon
* **Functional:** presumably
