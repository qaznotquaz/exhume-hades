# OnSpawnSwordTrait 

## My Two Cents
> when an enemy spawns, it has a 50% chance of having a `SpawnDelayDamage` effect which deals huge damage after `1.1` secs.
> damage range: **50-150**/**75-225**/**100-300**/**125-375**.
>
> looks like an ares boon - and rather powerful one at that. just going off of association, though.
