## My Two Cents
> increases the radius of dionysus' cast by **100**/**150**/**250**/**270** units, up from a base of `400`.
> interestingly, this also tells the `DionysusShoutWeapon`'s `DamageRaduis` to have the same value as what we just boosted - which is odd because, in the game's current form, that doesn't even *have* a damage radius!

## Notes
* **Source:** Dionysus
* **Functional:** presumably, not sure about the shout part
