# LimitedTimeTrait 

## My Two Cents
> this is a template trait with nothing but `LimitedTime = true`, which seems kind of uninteresting until you look into what that *does*. a better term for these traits are **Seasonal** traits - which seem to be or have been for a New Year's event or something along those lines. they're firework-themed!

## Notes
* **Functional:** presumably
* **See Also:**
