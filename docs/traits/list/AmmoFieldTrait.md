# AmmoFieldTrait 
![](BoonIcons/Zeus_08_Large.png)

## My Two Cents
> y'know *Lightning Rod*, the Artemis/Zeus boon? this is that, but for dionysus. i'm not entirely sure why it has a zeus icon.
> 
> this boon icon is not used in the game normally, but is also used by the unused [`WrathDamageBuffTrait`](WrathDamageBuffTrait.md).

## Notes
* **Source:** Zeus? Dionysus?
* **Functional:** dubious
