# WrathDamageBuffTrait 
![](Zeus_08_Large.png)

## My Two Cents
> this trait has a unique `DamagePerSuperStock` field, which provides a percent bonus to damage output based on how full your God Gauge is.
> 
> this boon icon is not used in the game normally, but is also used by the unused [`AmmoFieldTrait`](AmmoFieldTrait.md).

## Notes
* **Source:** Zeus
* **Functional:** presumably
