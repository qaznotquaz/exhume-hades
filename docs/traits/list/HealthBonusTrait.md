# HealthBonusTrait 

## My Two Cents
>provides a `MaxHealth` bonus of **20**/**30**/**40**/**50**.
>
>fun fact, i almost skipped this assuming it was `Tough Skin`, or perhaps `Spiked Collar`, until i checked and realized it's not referenced anywhere else.

## Notes
* **Source:** unclear
* **Functional:** presumably
* icon missing, unreferenced
