# SpearSpinChargeExplosions

## Helptext
> **Firework Spin**
> 
> Holding **Attack** creates miniblasts nearby that deal **{TooltipDamage}** damage.

## My Two Cents
> a firework-themed upgrade for the spear, in line with the other Seasonal traits. unfortunately, this entry is a bit of a lie, though - it only exists in the helptext! there's no traitdata for it! my best guess is that it was modified into the final game's `SpearSpinChargeAreaDamageTrait`, aka `Flaring Spin`. shame.

* **Source:** Daedalus
