# What's a Trait?
---
**short answer:** those things that boons, weapon aspects, keepsake effects, bonuses from charon's well, and the like are.

**long answer:** a trait is anything the game uses to apply modifiers to the player character - most of which are very apparent as little icons in the Boon menu you see when you press `B`. sometimes they're hidden.
