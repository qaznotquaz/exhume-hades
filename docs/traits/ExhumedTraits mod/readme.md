# Exhumed Traits Mod
a lot of [these traits](traitData_alphabetical.md) are really interesting to me, and i'd like to put them in the game at least to just experience them. it shouldn't be too difficult to add the nearly-complete ones to loot tables and such, but some will need icon fixes (either to more apt ones ingame, or entirely new icons if any artists are willing to help out!) and other changes to work correctly. of course, there's also enigmatic traits like [[RoomAmmoTrait]], and even ghost-traits, like [[SpearSpinChargeExplosions]]. i have some ideas, but i don't plan to write anything *new* for any of this.
