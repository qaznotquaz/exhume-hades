# Why do you want help?
dude do you know how many *things* there are in this game? in `TraitData.lua`, there are `488` traits. many of those are used in the game, but a significant portion never made it into the final build - and i want to document *all* of them. i also want to test all of them. not to mention other files, like `HelpText.en.sjson`, which i've already realized has secrets of its own!

i'm perfectly content to keep working on this by myself, but there's plenty of room for improvement if there's interest.

# What do you need help with?
*a list*

## Archival work
reading, understanding, and documenting things in the source code takes time, and with just one person working on it, things are bound to fall through the cracks. that doesn't only include missing items to document, but also misunderstanding or mislabelling things. so, having someone else to find and check information would be appreciated.

## Testing
checking whether things work is going to take time, and if i want to set up [projects](traits/ExhumedTraits%20mod/readme.md) to make experiencing this content available to others, i'm going to need to make sure things work! and, in the event that things *don't* work, i'll need to know why and how to fix it. this is the fun part, too.

## Artwork
i'm not sure how far this part will reach, but at least for the [traits](traits/list/traitData_alphabetical.md), this is ~~*technically* unecessary~~ much-needed, since so many of them are missing icons (and the game crashes if it tries to display a nonexistent icon). on top of that, even the ones that have icons are mostly duplicates of traits which are already in the final build! so, if anyone thinks they'd like to try their hand at trait icons, please let me know!
